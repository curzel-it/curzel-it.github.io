            <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
            This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of
            Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.<br>
            If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this
            policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not
            use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.<br>
            The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions unless otherwise
            defined in this Privacy Policy.<br>

            <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
            For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally
            identifiable information. The information that I request will be retained on your device and is not
            collected by me in any way.

            <h3>Log Data</h3>
            I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app I collect data and
            information (through third party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include
            information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the
            configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other
            statistics.

            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These
            are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal
            memory.
            This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and
            libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to
            either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to
            refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.<br>

            <h3>Service Providers</h3>
            I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>To facilitate our Service</li>
                <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
                <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
                <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
            </ul>
            I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal Information.
            The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
            disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

            <h3>Security</h3>
            I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
            acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method
            of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

            <h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>
            This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to
            that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review
            the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
            privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

            <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
            These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable
            information from children under 13 years of age. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided
            me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
            and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I
            will be able to do necessary actions.

            <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
            I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically
            for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
            This policy is effective as of 2021-07-08
