    <h1>Federico Curzel</h1>
    <p>
        I am a hands-on, highly competent Software Engineer. <br>
        I've spent most of my career working on Mobile Apps, especially iOS, but I've also worked on Android, backend
        and frontend, across many industries. <br>
        I currently lead an iOS team working on smart lighting and other IOT products. <br>
        Outside of tech, I quickly fall in love with any topic that stimulates my brain, from science and futurism to
        physics, space exploration, design... You name it. <br>
    </p>

    <h2>Personal Projects</h2>

    <h3>Hidden Mugs</h3>
    My very own YouTube Channel where I use animated characters to discuss and make fun of the latest Tech News.<br>
    The videos are generated using a tool i designed from scratch (Funnybot), which I have not open sourced as of
    yet.<br>
    Check it out <a href="https://youtube.com/@hiddenmugs">here</a>.

    Bit Therapy is an app that brings Desktop Pets to macOS, currently used by over 10.000 users every day!<br>

        href="https://apps.apple.com/app/desktop-pets/id1575542220">App

    <h3>Pipper</h3>
    Pipper is a web browser in its simplest possible form: a webview and exactly 6 buttons.<br>
    Its only distinctive feature is the ability to float over other windows, allowing content to be always visible.<br>
    Some early users have started to use it as a control panel for audio mixers, among other things.<br>
    The project is <a href="https://github.com/curzel-it/pipper/">open source</a> and will soon be available on the App
