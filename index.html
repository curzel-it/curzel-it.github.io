        <h1>Hey!</h1>
        <p>Chances are you didn't know, but there used to be a blog here!</p>
        <p>It was never really popular, nor did I ever really update it regularly, but, it was here nonetheless ðŸ˜…</p>
        <p>I know this page is awful, please don't judge, I just wanted something so I can host my contacts now that said blog is retired.</p>
       
        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>My name is Federico Curzel, I am an hands-on, creative and highly competent software developer who likes working with Mobile Apps (especially iOS!).</p>
        <p>I currently work in a remote, international team at Xanadu Consultancy Ltd as Lead iOS Developer, working on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/matchbook-betting-exchange/id503101282?mt=8">Matchbook App</a>.</p>
        <p>Other than mobile, I often work with most popular languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, Kotlin, C#...</p>
        <p>So yeah, nothing much else to say really!</p>
