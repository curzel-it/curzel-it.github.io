            Federico Curzel
        </h1>
        <p>
            I am a hands-on, highly competent Software Engineer. <br>
            I've spent most of my career working on Mobile Apps, especially iOS, but I've also worked on Android,
            backend
            and frontend, across many industries. <br>
            I currently lead an iOS team working on smart lighting and other IOT products. <br>
            Outside of tech, I quickly fall in love with any topic that stimulates my brain, from science and futurism
            to
            physics, space exploration, design... You name it. <br>

            <h3>SneakBit</h3>
            Started as a side project to learn Rust, it's now a fully-fledged game.<br>
            The game is a story-driven RPG, with aesthetic and mechanics heavily influenced by OG GameBoy games.<br>
            I personally made everything from scratch, including the engine and all the sprite (except for fonts, music
            and
            sound effects).<br>
            The project is <a href="https://github.com/curzel-it/sneakbit">open source</a>, but if you like the game
            please
            buy it :)

            Some early users have started to use it as a control panel for audio mixers, among other things.<br>
