<b>Subscription Terms for Bit Therapy (macOS)</b>
Bit Therapy for macOS offers an optional subscription that allows access to exclusive content. By purchasing 
or using the subscription (the “Subscription”), you agree to the following terms, in addition to all other terms 
included in this document:

1. <b>Subscription Access</b>:
   - The Subscription provides access to certain exclusive features, content, or services (“Exclusive Content”).
   - Specific details regarding the available features and pricing will be presented at the time of the subscription offer.

2. <b>Billing and Auto-Renewal</b>:
   - The Subscription may be billed as a recurring payment through the payment method or platform (e.g. Mac App Store) from which you originally purchased.
   - Your Subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless you cancel it at least 
     24 hours before the end of the current period.
   - You can manage or cancel your Subscription at any time by accessing your account settings in the platform’s 
     store or app settings.

3. <b>Free Trials</b>:
   - Any free trial, if offered, will be subject to the terms presented at sign-up.
   - If you do not cancel before the trial ends, your Subscription will automatically convert to a paid subscription 
     on the first day following the end of the trial period.

4. <b>Cancellation and Refunds</b>:
   - You may cancel your Subscription at any time, but no refunds will be provided for the unused portion 
     of the term, except where required by applicable law or according to the relevant platform’s refund policies.
   - Upon cancellation, you will retain access to the Exclusive Content until the end of the current billing cycle.

5. <b>Price Changes</b>:
   - We reserve the right to change our subscription fees at any time, but we will give you advance notice of any 
     price changes. 
   - If you do not agree to the new price, you may cancel the Subscription before the price change takes effect.

6. <b>Termination</b>:
   - We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your Subscription, in whole or in part, for any reason, including 
     violation of these Terms, with or without notice.
   - Upon termination of your Subscription for any reason, your right to access Exclusive Content will cease.

These Subscription Terms supplement the Terms and Conditions below. In case of conflict, these specific 
Subscription Terms for Bit Therapy (macOS) will take precedence for subscription-related matters.

<b>Terms and Conditions</b>
By downloading or using the app or service, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure 
therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. 
You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. 
You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate 
the app into other languages, or make derivative versions.
For translations, please reach out if you are willing to donate your time for adding new languages, so I can provide 
you with the proper support.
Some of my apps are open source, please refer to the licensing available in the repository of that specific project 
for instruction on how to contribute.
Licensing instructions in the official repository might override the contents of this document.
The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property 
rights related to it, still belong to Federico Curzel.

Federico Curzel is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, 
we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. 
We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re 
paying for.

The Bit Therapy app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide my Service. 
It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak 
or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official 
operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise 
your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Bit Therapy app won’t work properly or at all.

You should be aware that there are certain things that Federico Curzel will not take responsibility for. Certain 
functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, 
or provided by your mobile network provider, but Federico Curzel cannot take responsibility for the app not working 
at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.

If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement 
with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider 
for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. 
In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you 
use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. 
If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that 
you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.

Along the same lines, Federico Curzel cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You 
need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail 
the Service, Federico Curzel cannot accept responsibility.

With respect to Federico Curzel’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s 
important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, 
we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. 
Federico Curzel accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying 
wholly on this functionality of the app.

At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on macOS – the requirements for system 
(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need 
to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Federico Curzel does not promise that it will always 
update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the macOS version that you have installed on your device. 
However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. We may also wish to stop 
providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. 
Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination: 
(a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; 
(b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.

<b>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</b>
I may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. 
I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.

These terms and conditions are effective as of 2021-07-08 (updated on [DATE OF LATEST UPDATE]).
