        On Friday I stayed up late to finish outling the plot for my <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgWO0p8FHBHyqVfvbqEMS8m5k_vXO5gjf">next videogame</a>...<br>
        Nothing fancy, just a bullet list of events with a bunch of details, characters, motivations, themes, etc...<br>
        I usually have the alarm clock set to 6.30 AM every day, but being so late, I set it to 8 AM.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        The following is my Saturday morning:
        <ol>
            <li>Woke up at 8 AM, cigarette, bathroom, cigarette, breakfast, cigarette, ...</li>
            <li>8.30 I get on my laptop and dive into my game development endevours.</li>
            <li>First thing, the plot sounds cool, but I need feedback on it, so I asked Claude to turn my outline into
                a proper prose that I can have someone read as a short novel.</li>
            <li>After proof reading the thing I sent it to a local TTS model (Kokoro) to get an audio version to share
                with friends</li>
            <li>Go do some laundry</li>
            <li>Mow the loan</li>
            <li>Come back and, partially thanks to timezones, some friends where online and listened to it right away</li>
            <li>We discussed some minor changes, had Claude apply them</li>
            <li>Asked Claude to take my initial outline (which splits events into chapters/levels), list of characters,
                and the prose, and come up with a list of contextualized dialogue lines for each character</li>
            <li>Made a Python script to dub them all with Eleven labs</li>
            <li>The result was a list of about ~150 mp3 files along the lines of <em>"with clear anxiety in her voice she
                said bla bla bla"</em></li>
            <li>Damn, it's good, but I only need the <em>bla bla bla</em> part...</li>
            <li>Searched for tools to trim audio files quickly, macOS preview allows you to trim videos very easily, but
                apparently audio is too complicated for them... fine.</li>
            <li>Got Claude Code to make me an app where I can drag and drop a folder with mp3 files in it, display them
                in a list with spectogram, sliders to trim audio start and end, controls to play audio and a save button
            </li>
            <li>Go hung the laundry</li>
            <li>Come back... One shotted, that's nice</li>
            <li>Spend 30 minutes trimming each audio file</li>
            <li>Task Claude Code with allowing attaching audio dubs to dialogue items, assign correct audio files for
                the game prologue</li>
            <li>Go get groceries for a BBQ I have tonight</li>
            <li>Come back... One shotted, again</li>
            <li>Run some tests</li>
            <li>Prepare lunch</li>
            <li>Find some bugs, have Claude fix them while I eat</li>
            <li>All good, all fixed, lunch done, get coffee and lay down in the sun to relax a bit</li>
            <li>Realize it's still 11.30 AM</li>
        </ol>

        BBQ went nice btw
