<p>I am and hands-on, highly competent Software Engineer.
<br />
I’ve spent most of my career working on Mobile Apps, especially iOS, but I’ve also worked on Android, backend and frontend, across many industries. I currently lead an iOS team working on home automation and IOT projects.

Outside of tech, I quickly fall in love with any topic that stimulates my brain, from science and futurism to physics, space exploration, design… You name it.</p>
