## About me
I am and hands-on, highly competent Software Engineer.
<br>
I've spent most of my career working on Mobile Apps, especially iOS, but I've also worked on Android, backend and frontend, across many industries. I currently lead an iOS team working on home automation and IOT projects.

Outside of tech, I quickly fall in love with any topic that stimulates my brain, from science and futurism to physics, space exploration, design... You name it.

## Side Projects

### Pet Therapy 
*Since June 2022*
<br>
Pet Therapy is an app that brings Desktop Pets to macOS, currently used by over 10.000 users every day! The project is open source and available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/desktop-pets/id1575542220). An increasing number of assets are being drawn by me! Check it out [here](https://apps.apple.com/app/desktop-pets/id1575542220).

### Pipper
*Work in progress, Sept 2022*
<br>
Pipper is a web browser in its simplest possible form: a webview plus exactly 6 buttons. Its only distinctive feature is the ability to float over other windows, allowing content to be always visible. Some early users have started to use it as a control panel for audio mixers, among other things. The project is [open source](https://github.com/curzel-it/pipper/) and will soon be available on the App Store.

### MyGestionale
*Defunct, 2019*
<br>
MyGestionale was a simple Django-based solution for Point of Sales, Stock management, and CRM. The project ultimately failed due to a lack of time on my side.

### Tonite 
*Defunct, 2017*
<br>
Tonite was an app for iOS and Android that allowed users to find events nearby, aggregating data from various sources, including Facebook Graph API. The app reached over 20,000 monthly active users within a few months of its launch. Unfortunately, due to a change in Graph API offerings and terms of use, I had to shut it down.
